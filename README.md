# GriddlerSolver

A sample Q&D commandline application to solve a "griddler""or [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)": 
a logic game where a grid must be filled with black and white squares, based on clues.
The clues describe per row or column the lengths of the various stretches of black blocks there, which are separated by at least one white block.

No UI at all, the puzzle must be set in source code.
